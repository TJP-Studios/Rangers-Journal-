        <p id="">Picking the right travel backpack is an important part in planning your trip. Pick a bag that's too big and you'll have too much extra weight to carry around. Too small and you'll never fit all your stuff in the thing! Pick the wrong material and your stuff will be soaked when it rains.These days, there are so many backpacks out there that it can be confusing to know how to pick the right one. But there’s actually a science to knowing what the best travel backpack is — and how to pick it!
        When I first started traveling, I spent weeks picking out my first travel backpack. I tried on dozens, did hours of online research, and tested them in the store to get a feel for what they would be like.
        It was a time-consuming process. However, that research paid off though as my first backpack lasted me 8 years.
        In fact, the only reason I bought a new backpack was because an airline lost that bag. Otherwise, that backpack would still be around today. There are many travel backpacks in the world — and even more places where you can purchase one.
        How do you pick the best backpack for traveling?
        Today, I'm going to teach you how.
        To save you hours upon hours of research, I'm going to lay out all the good qualities a backpack should have, the best backpack brands, and where you can buy them so can save yourself hours of time and simply purchase one knowing it's amazing and going to last forever. </p>
        

        <strong>
             <p id="whattolookfor"> What to Look for in a Good Travel Backpack 
            </p> 
        </strong>
        <p> Here's a  how to dissecting my backpack and going over what I look for when picking the best backpacks for travel</p>
        
        
        <strong> 1. Resistant Material</strong>
        <p> While your pack does not need to be 100% waterproof (unless you're going on a long multi-day hike), make sure your bag is made out of a semi-waterproof material so everything doesn't get wet in a drizzle (most travel backpacks come with covers you can put over them in case of a severe downpour). <br>
        Moreover, make sure the material won't stay wet long and thereby get musty. I look for material that is thick but lightweight. Treated nylon fiber is really good. You should be able to pour a cup of water over it without the insides getting wet. I'm not traveling a lot during torrential downpours or monsoons, but I have been caught in small rainstorms before. Because my backpack is made out of good material, I've never opened my bag to find wet
        </p>
        
        <strong> 2. Lockable Zippers </strong>
        <p>Make sure each compartment has two zippers so you can lock them together. While I am not really worried about people breaking into my bag and stealing my dirty clothes in a hostel, I like locking up my bag when I am traveling. I'm always paranoid that someone is going to put something in my bag or that a grabby baggage handler in an airport is going to take my stuff.
        When purchasing locks, make sure the package says they are TSA-friendly locks. These locks have a special release valve that allows the TSA to open the lock without breaking it so they can check your bag. You can purchase TSA locks at any large retail store, such as Target or Walmart. <br>
        If you're extra concerned about security (such as if yo're a photographer that carries a lot of expensive equipment), you should consider getting a Pacsafe bag). These bags are specifically designed with security in mind, and have a ton of features to ensure that your bag isn't broken into or swiped.
    </p> 
        <strong> 3. Multiple Compartments </strong>
       <p> A good bag must have multiple compartments. This allows you to sort your belongings into smaller sections so it's easier to find the stuff you need. For example, my clothes are in the main compartment of my bag, my umbrella and flip-flops in the top, and my shoes in a separate side compartment (that way they don't get everything dirty). It saves having to dig around your bag. And while any bag you purchase should have multiple compartments, also pay attention to specialty compartments that might be important to you, such as a laptop sleeve or external water bottle pocket.  <br>
        For added organization, purchase some packing cubes. They can keep your bag organized — even if you have multiple compartments.
    </p>
        4. <strong> Padded Hip belt</strong>
       <p> Most of the weight you will be carrying around will be pushing down on your hips, so you'll want a padded belt to make supporting the weight more comfortable. The belt will help provide support and distribute the load more evenly on your back, causing less strain. The hip belt should also be adjustable so you can tighten it for extra support. Look for a bag that has zippered pockets in the hip belt too for easy access. These pockets are good for loose change, bus passes, and other small things you need quick access to.
    </p>
       <strong> 5. Padded Shoulder Straps </strong>
       <p> These make carrying your load more comfortable, as the weight of your pack will also be pushing down on your shoulders. The pads will put less pressure on your shoulders and also help take pressure off your lower back. Make sure the padding is very thick and made up of a single piece of material as it will be less likely to split and thin out. <br>
        The best way to test this out is to visit a store and try the bag on. Have a staff member load the bag with things so you can see how it feels on your shoulders when fully weighted.
    </p>
       <strong> 6. Contoured/Padded Back </strong>
       <p> A lumbar-shaped pack makes carrying it more comfortable, as it helps distributes weight more evenly (the same principle applies as is used in contoured chairs). It allows for a more natural arch to ensure no back pain. Moreover, this type of pack creates a small space between your back and the bag, allowing air to move through and help keep you slightly cool (lugging your bag around can work up a sweat!).
    </p>
      <strong>  7. Front Loading </strong>
       <p> A front-loading backpack is one that allows you to zip open the face from the side and access all your stuff. A top-loading bag only allows you to access your stuff from a hole in the top. This makes getting your stuff (especially if it is at the bottom of your bag) really difficult. Always get a backpack that is “front loading” so you have easy access to all your gear. <br>
        Conversely, a bag with both top-loading and bottom-loading will suffice as well. Just make sure you don't buy a bag with only one opening as that will make accessing your stuff inconvenient.

        <strong>Ultimate Carry On Packing List</strong>
    </p>

         <div class="packinglistwriteup">
        <p>Most airlines only permit one piece of carry-on cabin luggage that is under their specific weight restrictions (typically 5 to 10 kg). <br>
        </div>  
    Thankfully, some airlines permit two items, including one carry-on and one personal item (such as a handbag, backpack, laptop bag, umbrella, briefcase, etc.). that can be stored underneath the seat in front of you. Given this information, there have even been occasions when I have not checked any luggage at all. Instead, I only bring a carry-on backpack and a small rolling suitcase that holds my clothes, which is a VERY helpful arrangement for avoiding lengthy check-in lines. 
 But frequently, I only have room for one carry-on bag, leaving the others in storage. </p>

        <strong>A BACKPACK</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="backpack">
      <div class="backpackwriteup"> 
          <p>
        I've been searching for the ULTIMATE backpack that can protect and organize the items on my carry-on packing list, including cameras, for years. Since most backpacks are thin and "top-loading," you can simply stuff items inside and hope that you'll be able to locate them quickly later. I preferred a multipurpose bag that could separate my other carry-on items for easier access and organization while still keeping my tech gadgets safe. 
        Thankfully, my search came to an end last year when I came across Bagsmart's Camera Bag, which has quickly evolved into my go-to carry-on backpack. The bottom compartment is "front-loading" (like a suitcase) and can be divided into compartments with the aid of its movable velcro dividers.

         <strong>HANDBAG OR SMALL ROLLING LUGGAGE</strong>

    <div class="travelbagwriteup">
<p>
I strongly advise bringing a travel handbag for quick and simple access. I strongly advise taking a look at this camera tote bag, though, if you're looking for something that can hold your bulkier camera equipment. <br>
The size restriction for a carry-on varies across all airlines, as I've already mentioned. According to my research, you need a suitcase that is approximately this size: 22 high, 14 wide, and 9 deep, in order to be on the safe side of such limits. I personally use a Samsonite Luggage Winfield 20 because I appreciate how strong and light it is. Since I've been using it, it has genuinely withstood the damage caused by all of my.

<div class="liquidpouch">
    <div class="liquidpouchwriteup">
        <p>
        You'll need a clear liquid pouch that has been approved by the TSA if you intend to bring any liquids with you in your carry-on luggage. <br>
        Important information: I can fit everything on this list inside my Bagsmart camera bag by myself. In fact, even when everything is packed in, I always have room for a few extras.  Yep. It truly is amazing!

<strong>
    <p>
        SMART PHONE
    </p>
</strong>
<p>
    Its advantages are obvious, one of which is the availability of numerous practical travel apps on a smartphone to assist you while traveling. If you're interested, I have an iPhone with excellent camera specifications. If you're looking for a less expensive option, I suggest a Huawei phone because it has a great camera.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    EREADER OR TABLET  
</p>
</strong>
<p>
    Being a bookworm, I adore turning the pages of an old book with my fingertips. However, the reality is that books can be quite heavy, which is why I own an eReader. Since then, I've actually always traveled with my Kindle Paperwhite (to pass the time on lengthy flights, bus/train rides, lazy afternoons, etc.). ). 
 It has an incredible battery life and can hold a ton of books. I've previously taken a week-long vacation during which I read on my Kindle every day. I later found out that I didn't need to bring my Kindle charger because when it was time to head home, its battery life was still greater than half.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    LAPTOP
</p>
</strong>
<p>
    Another item on my list of carry-on packing essentials that is a no-brainer. Since I work remotely as a digital nomad, my laptop is essential to me. I always bring it when I travel. I've been using a 13-inch Macbook Pro for years; I'm aware that it isn't as portable or as thin as a Macbook Air, but I opted for it because I needed a device that could handle my graphic and video processing needs while traveling. (The weight difference between the two is not that great. When compared to most other laptops, my Macbook Pro is still significantly thinner and smaller. 
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    EAR PHONE
</p>
</strong>
<p>
    Perfect for blocking out background noise and entering my own musically-filled world. Additionally, I frequently wonder about the cleanliness of the provided headphones on lengthy flights, so I always make sure to pack my own. 
 Some individuals discover that headphones, such as noise-canceling models (e. g. ErgoFit In-Ear Earphones from Panasonic are recommended as a better item to pack in a carry-on bag. However, they can be quite large, which frequently strains my head and ears. I believe that earphones can provide almost the same features as headphones as long as you buy ones that are robust and properly sized for your ears (like the Airpods Pro).
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    CAMERA(OPTIONAL)
</p>
</strong>
<p>
    Your smartphone is sufficient to bring on your trip if you're not attempting to take professional-quality pictures like I do. But if you're anything like me, you frequently travel with multiple cameras stashed in your luggage. My standard photographic toolkit consists of the following:. 
 Canon Powershot G7 X for vlogging. 
 A 50mm prime lens and an all-purpose lens are available for my Canon 80D DSLR for general photography. 
 GoPro is for sports, action, and diving. 
 I suggest the Canon Powershot G7 X if you're not particularly interested in photography and just want a great point-and-shoot camera for your travels. No need to bring a bulky DSLR.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    PLUGS,ADAPTERS,CHARGERS
</p>
</strong>
<p>
    I put my chargers in a velcro-lined compartment of my CamPro bag and twist the wire ties around them to organize them and keep them from tangling altogether (alternatively, you could purchase an electronics or cable organizer). A universal adapter should, of course, always be carried.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    POWER BANK
</p>
</strong>
<p>
    When you have a layover and there are no outlets at the airport or in the nearby businesses, this is very useful for emergencies or just to extend the life of your gadgets. You'll also need this when you travel, so pack it in your carry-on since power banks cannot be stored inside checked baggage. Actually, I once got lost with a dead phone, but thanks to my Anker power bank, I quickly found my way out of that jam. Overall: It's always better to be safe and ready than sorry.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    POCKET WIFI
</p>
</strong>
<p>
    You can always buy a SIM card as an alternative, but since I frequently need to keep using my current SIM, I find owning a pocket WiFi more effective instead. I originally considered marking this as an optional item, but I believe that it is an essential item instead.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    DATA STORAGE
</p>
</strong>
<p>
    SSSIt's not a good idea to store hard drives in the check-in luggage for some people (like me, who works online). Nevertheless, you should take into account packing an extra memory card in case you require additional space for your photos or even in case of an emergency.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
    SMALL ITEMS
</p>
</strong>

</strong>
<div class="smallitems">

<img src="images/neck pillow.png" alt="">
</div>
<div class="neckpillowwriteup">
    I Initially disregarded the advantages earplugs might have. But when I finally gave it a try, it greatly assisted in blocking out the noise of the plane, some crying babies, snoring seatmates, and other things. Hearos Xtreme is a good option if you're thinking about purchasing these. My carry-on packing list must include eye masks and neck pillows, especially for long-haul flights because they make flying much more comfortable. <br>
    But when it comes to eye masks, I frequently purchase these Japanese steam eye masks because they greatly aid in soothing tired eyes and aid in preventing swelling following an "uncomfortable" flight's sleep. I urge you to try it, along with.
</div>
</div>
<div class="otherwriteup">
<strong>
    <p>
        pen
    </p>
</strong>
<p>
    A necessary item given that the majority of international locations require travel and the completion of customs forms. You wouldn't want to use the free pen at immigration while waiting for someone else to finish using it (yep, that actually happened to me), then watch in horror as she decides to claim it as her own. Because you will undoubtedly need them, save yourself the trouble and pack these items.
</p>
<strong>
    <p>
        Eye Glasses and Sun Glasses
    </p>
</strong>
<P>
    I also bring my graded glasses and their case when I travel because I am nearsighted in addition to a good pair of sunglasses. I also wear contacts, but I store them and the cleaning solution in my checked luggage because I normally avoid wearing contacts while flying (it could quickly dry out my eyes, especially on long flights). If you decide to wear your contact lenses during the flight, make sure to pack them along with their solution in your carry-on bag. Pack some eye drops if your eyes tend to dry out quickly.
</P>
<STRONg>
<P>
Toothbrush and Toothpaste
</P>
</STRONg>
<P>
    But occasionally, these are given away on lengthy flights. Be sure to bring your own though. I pack scaled-down versions of these things in my carry-on to save space. Colgate's miniature toothbrush pack is one example; you could also save some of the complimentary toiletries from hotels and use them on your subsequent flights.
</P>
<strong>
<P>
    Medication
</P>
</strong>
<P>
    Unlike in Asia, some medications are simply not given away without a prescription, so I still recall the hassle I went through when I realized I had forgotten my medications while traveling through Europe. Having said that, I believe it is essential to include the following items on your carry-on packing list in addition to the medications you personally require: pain relievers for headaches, diarrhea, nausea, and fever. (This is separate from a travel-sized first aid kit which I put away in my main luggage).
